# College Utilities Web App

Welcome to the **College Utilities Web App**!

This project is a **Skeleton Starter Kit** designed for first-year students to learn about Open Source Compilation. The pages are currently empty (skeleton mode) and are waiting for you to add the code!

## About the Project

This web app provides screen-ready HTML files for you to practice your coding skills.
**Your Goal:** Pick a page, implement the features using HTML and CSS, and see it come to life.

**Tech Stack:**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Yes, now allowed!)
- No Frameworks (React, Angular, etc.)

## Idea Board (What can you build?)

Here are some ideas for tools you can create or improve:

1.  **CGPA Calculator**: Create a form with drop-downs for grades and a button to "Calculate".
2.  **Attendance Tracker**: Build a UI that asks for "Total Classes" and "Attended Classes" and shows a progress bar.
3.  **Timetable Manager**: Create a beautiful HTML table to show exam dates.
4.  **Quick Notes**: specific a simple text area where students can type thoughts.
5.  **To-Do List**: specific detailed list with checkboxes for tasks.
6.  **Countdown Timer**: A timer that counts down from a set time.
7.  **Unit Converter**: Convert between different units (Length, Mass, etc).
8.  **Expense Tracker**: Add a new page to track daily college expenses!
9.  **Password Strength Checker**: Validate password strength (Weak/Medium/Strong).
10. **Typing Speed Test**: Test how fast you can type words per minute.
